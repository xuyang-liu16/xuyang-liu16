🌈 I am Xuyang Liu (刘旭洋), a third-year Master's student at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). I am also working as a research intern at [OPPO Research Institute](https://www.oppo.com/uk/), supervised by Prof. [Lei Zhang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/) ([PolyU HK](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), IEEE Fellow). Previously, I have interned at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/en) focusing on GUI Agent, and [Taobao & Tmall Group](https://talent.taotian.com/) working on Efficient VLMs. I've also spent half a year visiting [MiLAB](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Donglin Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/donglin-wang.html). I am fortunate to work closely with Dr. [Siteng Huang](https://kyonhuang.top/) from [DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/) and Prof. [Linfeng Zhang](http://www.zhanglinfeng.tech/) from [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

📌 My research centers on **efficient Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)**, including:

- 🖼️ **Image-Text LVLMs**: high-resolution understanding via context compression and fast decoding.
- 🎬 **Video Understanding**: long/audio-video, and streaming reasoning via efficient encoding and compression.
- ⚙️ **Efficiency Toolbox**: efficient transfer/fine-tuning and benchmarking for downstream task adaptation.

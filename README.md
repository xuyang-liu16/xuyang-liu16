ðŸŒˆ I am a third-year Master's student at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). I am also working as a research intern at OPPO Research Institute, supervised by Prof. [Lei Zhang](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/) (PolyU HK, IEEE Fellow). Previously, I have interned at [Ant Security Lab](https://securitylab.antgroup.com/home) focusing on GUI Agent, and [Taobao & Tmall Group](https://talent.taotian.com/) working on Efficient MLLM. I've also spent half a year visiting [MiLAB](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) at Westlake University, supervised by Prof. [Donglin Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/donglin-wang.html). I am fortunate to work closely with Dr. [Siteng Huang](https://kyonhuang.top/) from DAMO Academy and Prof. [Linfeng Zhang](http://www.zhanglinfeng.tech/) from SJTU.

ðŸ“Œ My research interests span **Efficient Vision-Language Models**, including:
* **Efficient Inference**: [VidCom<sup>2</sup>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14454), [GlobalCom<sup>2</sup>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05179), [FiCoCo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17686), [ToCa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05317), [Dense-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14700)
* **Efficient Training**: [M2IST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01131), [V-PETL Bench](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yS1dUkQFnu), [DARA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06217), [Dense-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14700), [AutoGnothi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21815)

ðŸ“¢ Recently, I am mainly focusing on **[Token-level Model Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19147)**, and applying it to efficient **long video understanding**. Feel free to reach out to me via Email `liuxuyang@stu.scu.edu.cn`, if you are interested in collaborating with me.
